Taking a stab at excalibur js game engine. Had made a text based game earlier, figured I'd try making the ui equivalent to it. 

Heard of excalibur js, instead of making a game engine by myself as was the case with the text based game, figured would use an off the shelf engine and build on top of it.

Learnt a bit of photoshop to create the pixel monsters/bosses in the game. Figured out tilemapping with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to create the map, adding some auto generated background particles randomly as well. Also figured this was a good place to learn the A\* algorithm for path finding so that mobile users could move to other locations by tapping there.

Couldn't be arsed to create a player character, so plagiarized pokemon for it, was working on an inventory system, the system in its initial stages consisted of boxes with items in top left. This was never polished in the end as I jumped onto other projects instead of polishing this.
